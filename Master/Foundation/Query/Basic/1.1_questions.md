# Connection Pooling
Connection pooling is a technique used in database management where a set of database connections is created and maintained for reuse by multiple clients or application requests, rather than establishing a new connection for each request.

# TTL (Time to Live) in Connection Pooling

TTL (Time to Live) in connection pooling is a setting that specifies the **maximum lifespan of each connection** in a pool. After this time expires, the connection is closed and removed from the pool, even if it’s still active. 

## Purpose of TTL in Connection Pooling

- **Lifetime Management**: Each connection is assigned a maximum lifetime (TTL). After the TTL, the connection is closed, preventing long-lived connections that can become stale.
- **Connection Recycling**: TTL ensures old connections are replaced with fresh ones, which helps in environments where connections may degrade over time or be affected by network issues.
- **Resource Optimization**: Stale or idle connections coBy implementing connection pooling, applications can achieve better performance, efficient resource utilization, and a more scalable architecture.nsume resources. TTL closes these connections, freeing up resources and improving system stability.

## When to Use TTL

TTL is useful in cases where:
- Connections may become stale if kept open indefinitely (common in databases and HTTP connections).
- Connections are sensitive to network or resource changes, and periodic refreshing prevents unexpected issues.
- You want to avoid resource exhaustion due to many open connections over time.

## Example: Setting TTL in a Database Connection Pool (Node.js)

Here’s an example using PostgreSQL's `pg-pool` module:

```javascript
const { Pool } = require('pg');

const pool = new Pool({
    max: 20,                      // Maximum number of connections in the pool
    connectionTimeoutMillis: 5000, // Max time to wait for a connection
    idleTimeoutMillis: 10000,      // Max idle time before a connection is closed
    maxLifetimeSeconds: 1800,      // TTL: Connection lifetime of 30 minutes
});
```
### Explanation of Parameters

-   **`max`**: Sets the maximum number of connections in the pool.
-   **`connectionTimeoutMillis`**: How long to wait when trying to establish a new connection.
-   **`idleTimeoutMillis`**: Time a connection can remain idle before being closed.
-   **`maxLifetimeSeconds`**: Sets the TTL, specifying that each connection in the pool will be recycled after 30 minutes.
 
 ### Benefits of Using TTL in Connection Pools

| Benefit                 | Description                                                                                   |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Resource Management** | Frees resources by closing idle connections.                                                  |
| **Improved Stability**  | Prevents potential issues from stale or long-lived connections.                               |
| **Scalability**         | Enables better handling of resource limits by periodically closing and renewing connections.  |
