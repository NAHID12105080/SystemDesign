## Push-Based Model

**Definition**: In a push-based model, data is **automatically sent (or "pushed")** from a source to one or more clients without the client needing to request it.

### Characteristics:
- **Automatic Updates**: The server pushes updates to clients as soon as they are available.
- **Event-Driven**: Commonly used in scenarios where real-time updates are crucial.
- **Examples**:
  - WebSocket Connections (e.g., chat applications)
  - Push Notifications (e.g., mobile app updates)

### Advantages:
- Instantaneous data delivery.
- Reduced latency for clients.

### Disadvantages:
- Can lead to unnecessary data transfer.
- More complex server-side logic required.

## Pull-Based Model

**Definition**: In a pull-based model, clients **request (or "pull")** data from a source whenever they need it.

### Characteristics:
- **Client-Initiated Requests**: Clients check for new data or request it as needed.
- **Polling**: Clients may poll for updates at regular intervals.
- **Examples**:
  - REST API Calls
  - Database Queries

### Advantages:
- Clients have control over data retrieval.
- Reduces unnecessary data transfer.

### Disadvantages:
- Can introduce latency in data retrieval.
- Increased load on the server during polling.

|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Data Transfer**       | Automatic, server-initiated              | Manual, client-initiated                  |
| **Data Delivery**       | Instantaneous updates                     | Delayed until the client requests data    |
| **Use Cases**           | Notifications, real-time applications     | API calls, database queries                |
| **Control**             | Limited client control over updates      | Full client control over data retrieval    |
| **Server Load**         | Can increase with many clients           | Can be high during polling                 |
