# Eviction algorithms
are used in caches to decide which data to remove when the cache is full. Two popular algorithms are 
- **LRU (Least Recently Used)** and
-  **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**.

# Comparison of LRU and LFU Cache Eviction Algorithms

| **Feature**            | **LRU (Least Recently Used)**                      | **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**                    |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Eviction Criterion**  | Removes the item that has not been accessed for the longest time. | Removes the item that has been accessed the least number of times. |
| **Focus**              | Recency of access.                                 | Frequency of access.                              |
| **Best Use Case**       | When recently used data is more likely to be reused. | When frequently used data is more important.      |
| **Data Structures**     | Doubly Linked List + Hash Map                     | Hash Map + Priority Queue or Frequency List       |
| **Tie-Breaking**        | Based on time of last access (oldest removed).    | Based on recency of access for equally frequent items. |
| **Complexity**          | O(1) for access and eviction.                     | O(log N) for eviction due to priority queue.      |
| **Memory Overhead**     | Moderate.                                         | Higher (needs frequency counters).               |
| **Advantages**          | Simple, fast, and intuitive for most use cases.   | Captures long-term patterns of usage effectively. |
| **Disadvantages**       | Cannot handle uneven access frequencies well.     | Complex and slower due to frequency tracking.     |
| **Example Use Case**    | Web browsers (recently accessed pages).           | Content delivery networks (frequently accessed files). |

# Use of LRU and LFU in Real-World Scenarios

| **Scenario**                                | **Problem**                                                                                                      | **Algorithm** | **How It Helps**                                                                                                                                                          |
|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Stock Market Deep Decline**               | Some stocks show a temporary decline, but you trust their future recovery and need to focus on them.             | **LRU**       | Keeps recently accessed (trusted) stocks in cache, evicting less relevant stocks. Ensures active stocks remain available for monitoring during their recovery phase.       |
| **Cricket World Cup Page Spike on Wikipedia** | Temporary high traffic to "Cricket World Cup" page, but important pages like "Algebra" still need to be cached. | **LFU**       | Prioritizes long-term frequently accessed pages (e.g., Algebra) over temporary spikes, ensuring essential evergreen content is not evicted during event-based traffic surges. |
