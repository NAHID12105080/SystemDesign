# Eviction algorithms
are used in caches to decide which data to remove when the cache is full. Two popular algorithms are 
- **LRU (Least Recently Used)** and
-  **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**.

## **1. Least Recently Used (LRU)**

### **What It Does**

-   LRU evicts the data that has not been used for the longest time.
-   It assumes that ***recently used data is more likely to be used again*** soon.

### **How It Works**

1.  Each time a cache item is **accessed**, it is marked as "recently used."
2.  When the cache is full, the **least recently used** item is removed

### **Implementation**
-   Use a **doubly-linked list** and a **hash map**:
    -   The list keeps the order of usage (most recent at the front).
    -   The map provides quick access to items.
## **2. Least Frequently Used (LFU)**
-   LFU evicts the data that has been used the **least number of times**.
-   frequently used data is more important.

### **How It Works**

1.  Each cache item is associated with a **frequency counter**.
2.  When the cache is full, the item with the **lowest frequency** is removed.
3.  If multiple items have the same frequency, resolve ties using another rule (e.g., remove the oldest).

### **Implementation**

-   Use a **hash map** for quick access and a **priority queue** or similar structure to track frequencies.
