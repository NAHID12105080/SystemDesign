# Fundamental topics in system design
Here are the most important six terms to keep in mind:

# Database

**Definition**: A structured collection of data that allows for efficient storage, retrieval, and management.

## Types:
- **SQL Databases**: Structured, relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- **NoSQL Databases**: Non-relational, flexible schema databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).

## Key Concepts:
- **ACID Properties**: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability - ensures reliable transactions.
- **Normalization**: Organizing data to reduce redundancy.
- **Indexes**: Data structures that improve retrieval speed.

## Best Practices:
- Choose the right database based on use case.
- Regularly back up data.
- Optimize queries for performance.

# Caching

**Definition**: The process of storing copies of files or data in temporary storage locations for faster access.

## Types:
- **In-Memory Caching**: Data stored in RAM for fast access (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
- **Disk Caching**: Data stored on disk to reduce access time to slower storage media.

## Key Concepts:
- **Cache Hit**: When requested data is found in the cache.
- **Cache Miss**: When requested data is not found in the cache, requiring a retrieval from the source.
- **Eviction Policies**: Strategies to remove old data (e.g., LRU - Least Recently Used).

## Best Practices:
- Use caching to reduce database load and improve response times.
- Set appropriate expiration times for cached data.
- Monitor cache performance and adjust size accordingly.

# Scaling

**Definition**: The ability of a system to handle increased load without impacting performance.

## Types:
- **Vertical Scaling**: Increasing the capacity of existing hardware (e.g., adding CPU/RAM).
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more machines or instances to distribute load (e.g., load balancers).

## Key Concepts:
- **Load Balancing**: Distributing incoming traffic across multiple servers.
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatically adjusting the number of active servers based on load.

## Best Practices:
- Plan for scaling early in the design process.
- Monitor system performance to identify bottlenecks.
- Ensure statelessness in applications for easier scaling.

# Delegation

**Definition**: Assigning responsibilities to different components or services in a system architecture.

## Key Concepts:
- **Microservices**: Breaking down applications into smaller, independent services that communicate via APIs.
- **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**: Using services to provide functionality over a network.

## Best Practices:
- Clearly define service boundaries and responsibilities.
- Use APIs for communication between services.
- Monitor and manage inter-service communication effectively.

# Concurrency

**Definition**: The ability of a system to execute multiple tasks simultaneously.

## Key Concepts:
- **Threads**: The smallest unit of processing that can be scheduled by an operating system.
- **Processes**: A program in execution, which contains one or more threads.

## Challenges:
- **Race Conditions**: Occur when multiple processes access shared resources simultaneously.
- **Deadlocks**: Situations where two or more processes are unable to proceed because each is waiting for the other to release resources.

## Best Practices:
- Use locks or semaphores to manage access to shared resources.
- Design systems to minimize shared state.
- Employ asynchronous programming models where appropriate.

# Communication

**Definition**: The methods and protocols used for data exchange between different components of a system.

## Types:
- **Synchronous Communication**: Components interact in real-time (e.g., REST APIs).
- **Asynchronous Communication**: Components communicate without requiring an immediate response (e.g., message queues).

## Key Concepts:
- **API Design**: Creating clear and consistent interfaces for communication.
- **Message Queues**: Systems that facilitate asynchronous communication (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka).

## Best Practices:
- Use the appropriate communication style based on use case.
- Ensure error handling and retries for communication failures.
- Document APIs for ease of use by other developers.
