# Delegation
### Main point:
#### **"What does not need to be done in real-time shouldn't be done in real-time."**

This principle helps optimize performance by deferring non-urgent tasks, reducing load on the API server, and improving response times for end users.
### Core Idea: Delegate and Respond

**Use Case**: Suppose a blogging site needs to update the total number of articles a user has written. This task doesn’t need to be processed in real-time as it isn’t critical for the immediate response to the user.

### Architecture Overview

1.  **Browser Request** ➔ **API Server**
2.  **API Server** ➔ **Message Broker (e.g., SQS, RabbitMQ)** ➔ **Workers** ➔ **Database**

Here’s the flow:

-   The API server processes the initial request, then delegates the task to a **message broker** (e.g., SQS or RabbitMQ) instead of handling it directly.
-   **Workers** (one or more) then pull messages from the broker and update the database asynchronously.
-   Finally, when a real-time read is required, the API server reads directly from the database to update the UI.

### Types of Message Brokers

1.  **Message Queues**:
    
    -   Examples: **SQS**, **RabbitMQ**
    -   Designed for **homogeneous consumers** (one consumer per message).
    -   Workflow: The consumer reads and deletes messages from the queue after processing, ensuring that each message is consumed once.
2.  **Message Streams**:
    
    -   Examples: **Kafka**, **Kinesis**
    -   Supports **heterogeneous consumers** (multiple consumers can read the same message independently).
    -   Workflow: Each consumer iterates over the messages in the stream at their own pace, allowing for independent processing.

### Kafka Example in Detail

-   **Workflow**:
    - **Browser Request** ➔ **API Server**
    - **API Server** ➔ **Kafka** ➔ **Search Service / Counter Service**
    -  **API Server** ➔  **Database** **->** **Update UI.**
      Services like a search or counter can consume messages from the Kafka stream at their own rate.
       Each service independently processes messages and updates the database accordingly.
