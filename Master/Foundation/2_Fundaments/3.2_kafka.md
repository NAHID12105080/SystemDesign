# Kafka Essentials
Kafka is a **distributed message streaming platform** used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. Messages are organized into **topics**, which Kafka partitions to enable parallel processing.

## Key Concepts

### Topics & Partitions
- **Topic**: A logical channel where related messages are grouped.
- **Partitions**:
  - Each topic is divided into **n partitions** for scalability.
  - **Partitioning Logic**: Messages are assigned to a partition based on a configured hash key, which determines the distribution.
  - **Ordering**: Kafka guarantees **message order within each partition** but not across different partitions, allowing distributed, high-throughput processing.

### Consumers & Offsets
- **Consumers**: Consumers are organized into **consumer groups**, with each consumer reading messages from one or more partitions.
  - **Limit on Consumers**: The number of consumers in a group cannot exceed the number of partitions; otherwise, some consumers would remain idle.
- **Offsets**: Each consumer keeps track of the last read message via an offset, committing this position at fixed intervals.
  - **Crash Recovery**: If a consumer fails before committing, it will restart from the **last committed offset**, ensuring **at-least-once delivery** (may result in re-processing of messages).

### Message Brokers
- **Message Queues**: Kafka can act like a traditional message queue with a single consumer per partition.
- **Message Streams**: Kafka supports multiple consumers within a consumer group, making it suitable for **heterogeneous consumers** who process messages independently at different speeds.

## Limitations

| **Limitation**                    | **Description**                                                                                                                                             |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Consumers per Partition**       | The number of consumers in a group cannot exceed the number of partitions.                                                                                  |
| **Potential Message Reprocessing** | If a consumer crashes before committing, it restarts from the last committed offset, which may lead to re-processing of messages.                          |
| **No Cross-Partition Ordering**   | Kafka only guarantees message order within each partition, so applications needing global ordering may require additional coordination logic.               |
| **Commit Lag**                    | Commit delays can result in outdated offsets if a consumer is delayed in processing, potentially leading to duplicated or delayed processing on restart. |

## Data Flow summary

1. **Producer** ➔ sends message to **Topic** ➔ Message is distributed across **Partitions**.
2. **Consumer Group** reads from partitions, committing **offsets** periodically.
   - If a consumer crashes, it resumes from the last committed offset.
3. Kafka’s design supports **scalability** and **resilience** by allowing multiple consumers to read from multiple partitions independently.

Kafka’s architecture ensures high-throughput, low-latency messaging with scalable consumer groups, suited for applications that benefit from parallel processing and do not require strict global message ordering.
